I create this web application using react+vite , tailwind, redux, redux-toolkit, axios.

To use this application -

first clone repository - https://github.com/anil2612coder/oriserve-assignment

run "npm install" in terminal,
run "npm run dev" then this application will start ,

you can search any package here, you will find all then package related to your search, if you click on single package you find all the version of this package and click on any version you will redirect to that version page where you find which dependencies and devDependencies this version is using.
